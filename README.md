# wpi-spotless

An extension for using the Java Spotless formatter (made for WPILib but works with anything using spotless)

## How to use
Ensure you have the Spotless dependency & configuration in your build.gradle file for this to work.

There's a command in the command bar called "Format with Spotless Formatter" (you can just type 'spotless' to get it).

Running the command will open a terminal that runs the command `./gradlew spotlessApply`
